# Monday.com API Integration Portfolio

## Overview

This repository showcases my skills in Python programming, data manipulation, and integration with GraphQL APIs, specifically focusing on the Monday.com API. The code provided here demonstrates how to interact with the Monday.com API using Python, perform data manipulation with pandas, and execute GraphQL queries to retrieve, modify, and create data within Monday boards.

## Features

- Integration with the Monday.com API to perform various operations on boards, items, and columns.
- Data manipulation functions to convert between DataFrame and JSON formats, match keys with column IDs, and create mandatory columns.
- GraphQL query functions to retrieve data from Monday boards, including items, column IDs, and item names.
- Mutation functions to create new boards, items, columns, and delete items from boards.
- Sample usage demonstrating the creation of a new public board on Monday.com, importing data from a DataFrame, and retrieving board data as a DataFrame.
